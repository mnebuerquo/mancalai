## About

This slideshow was created from templates using 
[Mnebuerquo's Argumentum ad Verecundiam](https://github.com/mnebuerquo/argumentum-ad-verecundiam).

This slideshow works using [Remark](http://remarkjs.com/) and
can be hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

When you are viewing the slideshow, space advances to the next slide, the up
and down arrow keys move back and forward.

If you are the presenter, press C to clone the window (one for the laptop, and
one for the projector display), and then with the presenter window selected,
press P to toggle presenter mode.

To host this slideshow using Github Pages, just visit this project's
settings and change the Github Pages branch to `master`.
